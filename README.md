# Spooky Electron Apps

Here's my talk BrooklynJS #59: https://speakerdeck.com/pixely/spooking-your-friends-with-electron-brooklynjs-number-59

This demo code was put together for demonstration purposes only. Use at your own risk.

To run this locally, clone this repo, run `npm install`, then run `npm start`.

To change the demo that's loaded, edit line 26 of main.js:

- `activate-windows.html` - Activate Windows
- `crack.html` - Cracked screen
- `glitch.html` - Glitchy screen (probably has a memory leak somewhere)
